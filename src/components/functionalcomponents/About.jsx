            <p id="about">I'm Nikita Nalankilli, a passionate software developer with a flair for creativity. My journey in coding began with a curiosity 
            that has now evolved into a deep passion. I love exploring new technologies,
             including VLSI design and React development, and solving problems. When I'm not coding,
              you can find me immersed in books or enjoying nature's beauty.
